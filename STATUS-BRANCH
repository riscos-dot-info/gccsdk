This gccsdk/branches/developers/joty/gcc branch is to develop a GCCSDK based
on gcc4.6trunk together with binutils 2.20.1.  When it is stable enough, it
then can become candidate for merging to gccsdk/trunk/gcc4.

Status patch merging:

- All patches which could be merged more or less straightforwardly, have been
  merged.  The ones which were backport merges were dropped.
  Patches which didn't apply or were in doubt they are still relevant have
  been moved to recipe/patches/gcc/unused.  The further we are with this port,
  it will become clear what their status is (when no longer needed, they will
  be removed).
- recipe/files/gcc/gcc/config/arm/{riscos.c,riscos-elf.h}: the throwback
  support has been disabled (search for 'FIXME') as its implementation needs
  to be partially redone (hopefully in a cleaner way so that parallel building
  works again).  Note gcc now reports columns as well in their warnings/errors
  so this is something we can support in our throwback code as well.

Status build:

- Enable languages c and c++, multilib configuration with static target libs
  cleanly builds.
- Didn't try any other languages nor shared library configuration.
- The 'riscos' subprojects all build with the made cross-compiler except
  d.so-1.9.9/d-link

Status test:

- Very minimally: UnixLib is atm broken that its exit() code no longer has the
  call to _Exit() resulting in a crash at the end of each execution.

Upstream gcc bug tracking:

- UnixLib exit()/_Exit()/_exit() malcompilation:
    "Function with attribute noreturn omits a call to another function with noreturn"
    http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44974
  Currently avoided by doing an alias hack in UnixLib's unix/unix.c file.
- RISC OS target's option crash:
    "ICE in cancel_option()"
    http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31980
  Currently patched by: recipe/patches/gcc/gcc.opts-common.c.p
- Buffer overflow in *push_multi pattern
    http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45029
  Currently patched by one of the hunks in recipe/patches/gcc/gcc.config.arm.arm.md.p
